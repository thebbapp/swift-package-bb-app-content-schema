# ``BbAppContentSchema``

Data structures and models for application content.

## Overview

The BbAppContentSchema library defines the core data models for all content types in the BbApp ecosystem. It provides comprehensive structures for posts, comments, and sections, including their associated metadata, capabilities, and status information. The library is organized into logical groups with dedicated subdirectories for comment-related types, post-related types, and section-related types, along with utility functions for mock data generation and navigation integration.
